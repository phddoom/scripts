These are various scripts that I write to simplify my daily life.
Or sometimes just to have fun programming.
As I am currently working in Ruby most scripts will be implemented in Ruby.
Other languages might follow in my pursuit of learning. 

Script Ideas

ding!_commands_done
  use dzen2 or notify-send to alert user when command/process is done

a dzen library/wraper
  perhaps a addon to the String class to dzen2 escape strings correctly
